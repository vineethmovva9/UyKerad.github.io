## 2. Introduction
Professional tennis is a highly dynamic sport where match outcomes are influenced by a multitude of complex variables. While the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) ranking system provides a reliable metric of long-term player consistency, upsets, a scenario where a statistically inferior player defeats a higher-ranked opponent, do occur. This project uses a dataset of over 60,000 ATP tennis matches to build a machine learning classification model that predicts the likelihood of these ranking-based upsets. By integrating ranking differences, playing surface, match round (within a tournament), betting odds, and match format, this analysis seeks to uncover the statistics behind upsets.

We aim to answer the following question: What are the most significant pre-match factors that affect upsets?

This analysis bridges sports analytics and practical data science. In tennis, predicting upsets reveals factors that rankings may miss. It can help us understand how robust and accurate the betting market for tennis is.  

## 3. Data Curation
We are using a dataset from Kaggle which contains over 60,000 matches from ATP tennis matches. ATP is the top tier tour for professional men’s tennis, so the dataset is looking at the best players in the world. This means the ranking system is highly structured and updated consistently, so the ranking variable is more statistically reliable and interpretable. Furthermore, ATP players are all elite professionals, so there will be less random variance in performance, which means the effects of variables such as court surface and match round will have a higher relative importance. The dataset contains tournament name, type, location, the data and match round, whether it was indoor/outdoor, the surface type, the player names, ranking, and winner, odds for each player, as well as the score and match format.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
### 4.1 Does Court Surface Affect Upset Rate? (Chi-Squared Test)

```

### 4.2 Does Court Type (Indoor/Outdoor) Affect Match Length? (T-Test)

```
# keep only relevant columns
ct = df[["Court", "Score", "Best of"]]
ct = ct[ct["Best of"] == 3]

# drop missing values

### 4.3 Are there outliers in the rankings of people who defeat top-10 players? In other words, what are the biggest upsets?
```

## 5. Primary Analysis
### 5.1 Motivation
Our exploratory data analysis confirmed that variables linked the tournament context all correlate with upset probability. We now build a binary classification model to predict whether a given match will be an upset (1) or not (0).
We will compare three models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting
   
### 5.2 Feature Engineering
We will engineer the following features:
1. **log_rank_diff** - Log of absolute ranking gap between players; A higher value means more one-sided on paper
2. **log_favored_rank** - Log of the higher ranked player's rank; Captures the quality of the favorite
3. **implied_prob_fav** - Normalized implied probability from betting odds
4. **round_num**- Encoded tournament round (1st Round -> Final)
5. **series_tier** - Tournament prestige tier (International -> Grand Slam)
6. **Best_of** - Match format (3 or 5 sets)
7. **Surface** - One-hot encoded court surface
   
```

**Test Data Analysis (Results).** We trained/evaluated models on **62,090** matches with valid odds. The upset rate was **0.3459** and an 80/20 stratified split preserved this rate in both train and test sets.

As a baseline, always predicting “no upset” achieved **Accuracy = 0.6541** but **Balanced Accuracy = 0.5000** and **F1 = 0.0000**, since it never identifies any upsets (confusion matrix [[8123, 0], [4295, 0]]). This highlights why accuracy alone is not a good metric for this problem.

**Logistic Regression** performed best overall for identifying upsets, with **ROC-AUC = 0.7186** and **PR-AUC = 0.5564**. At a 0.5 threshold it achieved **Precision = 0.5072**, **Recall = 0.6421**, and the highest **F1 = 0.5667** (confusion matrix [[5443, 2680], [1537, 2758]]). This model catches many upsets (high recall) but produces more false upset predictions.

**Random Forest** achieved slightly higher accuracy (**0.6655**) but lower ranking performance (**ROC-AUC = 0.7064**, **PR-AUC = 0.5431**) and a slightly lower **F1 = 0.5440**. It is more conservative than Logistic Regression (lower recall), producing fewer predicted upsets overall (confusion matrix [[5786, 2337], [1817, 2478]]).

**Gradient Boosting** achieved the highest **Accuracy = 0.6945** and the best **PR-AUC = 0.5580** with strong **Precision = 0.6018**, but it had much lower **Recall = 0.3448** and **F1 = 0.4384** (confusion matrix [[7143, 980], [2814, 1481]]). This indicates it predicts upsets less often (fewer false positives) but misses many true upsets.

**Conclusion.** If the goal is to **detect upsets** (not just maximize accuracy), **Logistic Regression** provides the best balance of precision/recall and the strongest F1 score. If the goal is to make **fewer upset predictions with higher confidence**, **Gradient Boosting** is preferable due to its higher precision.
